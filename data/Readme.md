This folder contains data used and generated by data processing, invocation and plotting IntARNA-SHAPE analysis. 

* One subfolder is provided per mRNA  and snRNA gene. 

* U1 contains data obtained using StructureFold galaxy tool on DMS-seq probing experiment. 
* Fasta files contains RNA sequences for each gene loci using bedtools and TAIR10 reference genome.
* `intarna-subopts*gene_.csv` files contain IntARNA interactions predictions (`--out=intarna-subopts.csv' option).
* `intarna-spotprobs*gene_.csv` files contain IntARNA interactions predictions (`--out="spotProb:"` option).
* `*png` figures visualize interaction energy heatmaps and splice-junction interaction probabilities as barplots.
